## Training Overview
Magnus is distraught over his perceived failure to protect his friends/team, as it feels like he will inevitably repeat something similar to his previous failure to save his world. As a result, he dives head first into training to fill anything he perceives as a weakness. As evidences by the last mission, this can be broken down into:
- Physicality
- Positioning
- Reaction Speed

In order to address these, he has a training montage with Marcello, and alone:
- Marcello
	Magnus heard about Marcello from Betty- Marcello refuses to train him initially, but Magnus meditates outside of Marcello's Dojo day and night, in a hunger fast, to train his will, until after a few days Marcello lets him in. Marcello helps him improve his brawling, and his speed, hone his battlefield reflexes, and helps him learn power blow, and weapon master (as well as the 'Marcello' training).
- Alone
	Magnus trains with the will to hone his connection to the timeline- he masters a time pausing spell for positioning (Temporis Fractus), and through a honing of his connection to the timeline, learns speeds up his perception (Enhanced time Sense), and learns to predict the movements of others more reliably (Precognitive Parry).

Magnus trains at these things single mindedly for several weeks, and is notably more 'Intense' the next time the team meets him. Clearly under a lot of stress, but also having been faced with the choice to crumble under his own fears and expectations for himself, or to make a change and improve, and having chosen the latter.

## Trainings
- Marcello
- Defensive Mastery
## Skills
- Due to increases in Will, intimidation became by far my best influence skill. This is due to people seeing in him, very quickly, that his motivations are such that he will stop at nothing to do what he feels is right. People feel that he WILL endanger his own life if he thinks its necessary.
### Worked on
- Staff
- Brawling
### Learned
- Precognitive Parry
- Power Blow
## Advantages
- Weapon Master
### Magical Abilities
- Enhanced time sense
### Spells
- Added regeneration spells for Energy/Luck instead of the standard ER rules, which allow ER to just regenerate in the background, and require that we know how much time has passed. Let me know what you think of these, I'm happy to fuck with them.
- Temporis Fractus (Fractured Time)
```
Allows the caster to freeze time in their immediate surroundings for the purpose of travel.

Nothing can be interacted with, picked up, set down, etc. The user has fractured the local timeline to move in a split second, and cannot abuse this in any way. The only persistent effect of this ability is to relocate to a place they could feasilby move to with their normal navigation abilities.

e.g. they must be able to walk, jump, climb there using abilities they posess.
